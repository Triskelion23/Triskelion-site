      <h2>From Silicon to Steam: The Triskelion Origin</h2>
      <p>Triskelion Energy was born not in a boardroom, but in a flash of insight — sparked by the same spirit that drove the original NC State Wolfspeed founders. They saw a path to cleaner, more resilient systems through wide bandgap semiconductors. We saw our path in geothermal fire and volcanic steam.</p>

      <p>Founded by a scientist-inventor with roots in Norman and Sicilian heritage, Triskelion emerged from a vision to harmonize nature's chaos — not control it. Our goal: to turn Earth's volcanic breath into balanced energy, tapping steam from Mount Etna and similar sites around the world.</p>

      <p>Like Wolfspeed, we believe in materials that endure, ideas that scale, and energy that flows. But instead of silicon wafers, we shape pressure, flow, and earth-forged heat into power. Our systems are inspired by nature’s own design — decentralized, adaptive, and always seeking balance.</p>

      <p>We are not rivals of Wolfspeed — we are its geothermal cousins. Where they went inward into chips, we reach outward into the crust. Together, we represent two branches of a new world order: one where technology obeys the laws of nature, not just the market.</p>
